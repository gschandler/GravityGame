GravityGame
===========

Arduino based game using the Adafruit Bi-color LED display and LSM303DLHC

This was created as a whim on Arduino Day 2014 as an exercise in using both the Bi-color LED display and LSM303DLHC acceleromter in a novel way. I used an Arduino Uno R3 to power it, but I would like to see if I can pare it down to fit in an Adafruit Tinket.
